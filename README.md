# Quiz

A simple quiz made with react &amp; typescript

1. Using Open trivia API (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) I selected the book category.
1. With the fetch created we can start to build the quiz.
1. With the hook useState we set all the states we need to develop the quiz.
1. After this, code one functionality at a time. Make sure everything works before keep coding.
